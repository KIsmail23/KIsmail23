Hi, I’m Ismail Kadri, a Quantitative Risk & Financial Modeling Specialist working at the intersection of finance, data, and technology.
I build scalable financial modeling pipelines for pricing, market risk, credit risk, regulatory modeling, and financial analytics.
My core skills include Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, Machine Learning, Power BI, and Tableau, enabling both advanced modeling and clear visualization.
I focus on transforming complex financial data into actionable insights for quants, risk teams, and decision-makers.
Currently, I’m working on AI-driven financial modeling pipelines for credit risk, market risk, and intelligent financial systems.

Most of my work is hands-on — real code, quant logic, risk assumptions, financial mathematics, and tested AI workflows built for production use in financial institutions. I design agents and tools that bring together:

📈 Derivative Pricing | Monte Carlo | PDEs | Numerical Integration
🔐 Regulatory Models | Basel | CCAR | DFAST | CECL | SR 11/7
📊 Market Risk Analytics | VaR | CVaR | Stress Testing | Model Validation
🤖 AI Agents | RAG | Multi-Agent Systems | Memory | Tool Calling
📦 Ready-to-run agent templates for Risk, Pricing, and Regulatory Automation

I run the open-source Awesome FinRisk AI, where I publish complete AI agent templates, quant starter kits, pricing models, and agent-powered regulatory analytics—built to help developers and risk analysts skip the noise and start building real financial AI systems.

What I build

🧠 AI Agents for Financial Risk: pricing agents, model validation agents, RAG analysts, regulatory compliance copilots
📦 Clone → Install → Run quant-ready agent workflows
🔧 ML & Agent Workflows: logging, evaluation, planning, auditability, tool integration
📊 RAG for Finance: research papers, risk policy docs, regulations, market data, investor reports
📑 Chat-with-any-financial-document: PDFs, market reports, Basel papers, trade logs
🚀 Fine-tuning & Custom Models: Llama, GPT, Gemma for risk analytics and pricing optimization
📈 Full code-first crash course on Financial Agent Development, Risk Modeling, and OpenAI SDK

🌱 Interested in what's next at the intersection of AI Agents, Derivative Pricing, Market Risk, and Regulation?
Let’s build intelligent financial systems together.
