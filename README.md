🎯 AI Agent Builder | Quantitative Risk & Financial Modeling Specialist
Building AI Agents for Pricing, Market Risk, Regulatory Models & Financial Analytics | Python • R • SQL • ML • MATLAB 

I build AI Agents and financial modeling pipelines that help quants, risk teams, and analysts price derivatives, validate models, analyze market risk, automate regulatory compliance, and transform financial decision-making with intelligent systems.

Most of my work is hands-on — real code, quant logic, risk assumptions, financial mathematics, and tested AI workflows built for production use in financial institutions. I design agents and tools that bring together:

📈 Derivative Pricing | Monte Carlo | PDEs | Numerical Integration
🔐 Regulatory Models | Basel | CCAR | DFAST | CECL | SR 11/7
📊 Market Risk Analytics | VaR | CVaR | Stress Testing | Model Validation
🤖 AI Agents | RAG | Multi-Agent Systems | Memory | Tool Calling
📦 Ready-to-run agent templates for Risk, Pricing, and Regulatory Automation

I run the open-source Awesome FinRisk AI, where I publish complete AI agent templates, quant starter kits, pricing models, and agent-powered regulatory analytics—built to help developers and risk analysts skip the noise and start building real financial AI systems.

What I build

🧠 AI Agents for Financial Risk: pricing agents, model validation agents, RAG analysts, regulatory compliance copilots
📦 Clone → Install → Run quant-ready agent workflows
🔧 ML & Agent Workflows: logging, evaluation, planning, auditability, tool integration
📊 RAG for Finance: research papers, risk policy docs, regulations, market data, investor reports
📑 Chat-with-any-financial-document: PDFs, market reports, Basel papers, trade logs
🚀 Fine-tuning & Custom Models: Llama, GPT, Gemma for risk analytics and pricing optimization
📈 Full code-first crash course on Financial Agent Development, Risk Modeling, and OpenAI SDK
